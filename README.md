This is a game created as a parody of intersectional politics made for IGA Impact Jam 2022.

I made this game as a joke in order to learn the Godot game engine. Don't take it seriously.

A playable exe has been placed in folder "Playable EXE Here" for easy playability in the future without needing to re-export.
